## Introduction:
CORDIC (Coordinate Rotation DIgital Computer) based algorithms are some of the most hardware-efficient algorithms because they require only iterative shift-add operations. The CORDIC algorithm eliminates the need for explicit multipliers and is suitable for calculating a variety of functions.
